Wow. Just stepped out of Ad Vitam and my brain is honestly, like, in a blender right now. Imagine slicing through the idea of immortality and all the shiny, messed-up baggage that comes with it. If you think about it too hard, you'll probably need an aspirin. Or a nap. Or both. I mean, what’s the deal with living forever? Sounds dreamy until you’re getting bored in your own infinite existence, right?

Okay, let’s take a second to talk about the visual overdose going on in there. There were colors—neonish ones—that felt like they were screaming at my eyes. I swear, at one point, I started thinking I was part of some strange futuristic disco cult. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing until you realize you're kinda lost in a blur of light and existential dread. But really, Ad Vitam doesn't just whisper to you about this future where people can live forever—it slaps you with it. Like a wet sock, and you’re not even mad, you’re just... wet.

> These characters, man, felt like they were all doing pirate cosplay by steering their own bizarre ships through stormy seas of identity crises. It’s melodramatic in that way you don’t decide to take your popcorn-stuffed self too seriously because they’re not actually asking you to. 

You’re rooting for them and also not because let’s be real—youth obsessed society got them in one tangled mess of cables. Speaking of tangles, there was this one scene with cables or cords or tentacles maybe? It blurred and bended like someone spilled tech paint and started molding life from it. You ever been tangled up with your headphones? Multiply that by immortality angst.

if(life > death) { code((living)++; immortalityFlavor()); } // superhero logic?

The actors definitely nailed it, too. Some bits where they're all wrestling with their forever-spanning feelings felt like they were characters pulled out from an infohazard tapestry hung in the weird corner of your brain. You can't decide whether to love or laugh at ‘em, and maybe that’s the whole vibe. Maybe I need to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again to figure it out.

Anyway, now I’m standing outside the theater with the night air, weirdly grounding after all that futuristic hoopla. Is it perfect? Nah. Was it real and gritty and almost too much in the right ways a   should be when taking on giants like time and immortality? Yeah, it kinda was. So here’s to untangling thoughts, one messy piece at a time. Hope I didn’t leave my umbrella in the theater...
